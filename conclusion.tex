In this paper, we have formalized many of the things that intuition would tell us. Namely, we have shown that a straight line is the fastest way to get between two points. This fact is unsurprising because of the fact that acceleration in a single direction (toward the finish point) is the least wasteful means of getting to the finish.

We developed a number of simple lemmas governing the motion of a volume-less particle with bounded acceleration. We also showed that symmetric paths tend to be better than non-symmetric paths (through our simple quadrilateral path minimization problem).

Finally, we found an optimal path for a particle to trace around three cones when the particle has constant velocity.
